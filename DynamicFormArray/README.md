# DynamicFormArray

This project demonstrates how to implement a Dynamic Search Form in an Angular application that will create a custom request object that can be POSTed to and web service.

There will be a companion project to this one, which is an ASP.NET WebApi project that can dynamically build a Linq query to be used with Entity Framework.

But this Angular Search Form component can be used with any back-end to handle the database querying, but you would have to provide the code for that yourself.
